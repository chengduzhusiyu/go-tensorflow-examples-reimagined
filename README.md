# Go TensorFlow Examples Reimagined

This repository is a collection of comprehensive examples for model inference utilising the TensorFlow Go API. More are continually being added. New contributors are encouraged to join in by enhancing existing examples or adding new simple examples. Please submit a pull request or an issue on GitHub for your contributions.

## Models

- [Image Classification](image_classification) - Classifies the dominant object category within an image.

- [Image Object Detection](image_object_detection) - Identifies object categories and locates them on the image using bounding boxes.

- [Image Instance Segmentation](image_instance_segmentation) - Identifies each object instance of each pixel for all known objects in the image with instance-aware labels.

- [Image Semantic Segmentation](image_semantic_segmentation) - Identifies the object category of each pixel for all known objects in the image. The labels here are class-aware.

- [Image Enhancement](image_semantic_segmentation)
